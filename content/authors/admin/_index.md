Broadly, I am interested in understanding how cognitive and emotional skills, such as cognitive control and emotion regulation, develop, promote health and well-being, and serve as buffers against stress and maladaptive coping strategies, such as unhealthy eating and substance use.

I'm also interested in understanding how motivational factors, such as choice, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation, affect goal pursuit and self-regulation. 

I use univariate and multivariate neuroimaging methods to investigate how control and motivational processes are represented in the brain and how they influence decision making and behavior within task as well as outside the lab.

The overarching goal of my research is to use neuroscience to design and evaluate translational interventions that facilitate health behavior change and improve health and well-being across the lifespan.
