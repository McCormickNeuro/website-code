abstract: Early adolescence is a time of flux in self-concept and self-esteem, as well as when puberty takes place. However, there is limited research on the neural correlates of self-evaluation in relation to pubertal development. The current study aimed to examine how age and pubertal development associate with neural activation during self-evaluation in a community sample of girls, as well as if these associations depend  on  the  type  or  valence  of  the  evaluated  trait.  Participants(N=143;  age M=11.65, SD=0.82, range  10.0-13.0)  completed  a  functional  MRI  task  in  which  they  judged  the  self-descriptiveness  of adjectives describing prosocial, antisocial and social status-related traits. Pubertal development was examined   using   the   self-reported   Pubertal   Development   Scale,   as   well   as   morning   salivary testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and estradiol. Contrary to preregistered hypotheses, age and pubertal development were not related to neural activation during self-evaluation. We also examined whether  activation  in  two  areas  linked  to  self-referential  processing,  the  ventromedial  prefrontal cortex  (vmPFC)  and  perigenual  anterior  cingulate  (pgACC),  could  predict  trial-level  self-evaluative behaviour. In line with the preregistered hypothesis, higher vmPFC and pgACC activation during self-evaluation  both  predicted  more  endorsement  of  negative  items  and  less  endorsement  of  positive items. Future studies should test longitudinal associations, as well as the predictive value of the neural correlates of self-evaluation for mental health in adolescence.
