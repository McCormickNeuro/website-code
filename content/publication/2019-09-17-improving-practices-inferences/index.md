abstract: As developmental cognitive neuroscientists, we share a common goal of being able to draw strong, defensible, reliable inferences from our neurobiological data. The past decade has seen growing concern about research practices and introspection regarding how to improve the field (Yarkoni, 2009). This manuscript focuses on the importance of distinguishing between confirmatory versus exploratory data analysis approaches in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Regarding confirmatory research, we discuss problems with analytic flexibility, appropriately instantiating hypotheses, and controlling the error rate given how we threshold data and correct for multiple comparisons. To counterbalance these concerns with confirmatory analyses, we present two complementary strategies. First, we discuss the advantages of working within an exploratory analysis framework, including estimating and reporting effect sizes, using parcellations, and conducting specification curve analyses. Second, we summarize best practices that support transparent and reproducible research in our field, which are particularly important for defensible null-hypothesis significance testing in confirmatory analyses. Specific recommendations are given, and templates, scripts, or other resources are hyperlinked, whenever possible.
